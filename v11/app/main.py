#--- Database Migration ---#
# https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html
#Currently whenever we want to change our table properties we have to 
#drop the table and create it again, this isn't ideal 
#We're going to use a tool called Alembic so that whenever we add a col
#in a table from our models.py it automatically updates the db 
#We'll manage our db using Alembic instead of doing it manually or using workarounds  
#It allows to create incremental changes and rollback our db models/tables/schemas
#like we do with out code using GIT
# alembic init dir_name
#We drop all tables, we have no tables defined
#We'll go through this step by step as if we knew about alembic from start
#We create a "posts" table, then "users" table,
#then we setup a relationship along with the necessary foreign keys
#then we create "votes" table and setup the necessary foreign keys for that as well
# alembic revision -m "message_comment" like git commit -m
#Revisions track all of the changes, we can find it under alembic\versions dir 
#We have to setup the upgrade() and downgrade() funcs manually in the revisions dir
# alembic upgrade revision_id
#This will create the "posts" table as well as a "alembic_version" table
#alembic uses the latter table to keep track of the revisions    
#We add a new col to "posts" table by creating a new revision
# alembic revision -m "add content column to posts table" 
#Again we put in the logic for upgrading and downgrading
# alembic current
# alembic heads
# alembic upgrade head OR alembic upgrade revision_id
# alembic downgrade -1 OR alembic downgrade revision_id 
# alembic revision -m "add users table"
# alembic history
# alembic upgrade +1 OR alembic upgrade revision_id
# alembic upgrade head
#This time we'll not manually create the "votes" table, we're gonna use the auto-generate feature
#alembic will take a look at all of our models and based on the cols we have set here,
#it'll figure out what the diff between our models and db and make necessary changes
# alembic revisions --autogernate -m "message_comment"
# alembic upgrade head 
# 
#--- CORS Policy ---#
#Till now we've been testing our API by sending requests from Postman
#here we actually send the request from our own pc 
#but in the reality our API can get requests from diff kinds of devices
#we can get requests from a pc/server through Postman or even CURL
#Postman does the same thing as CURL but has a nice GUI
#We can also get requests from mobiles/web browsers   
#When a web browser sends a request using JavaScript's fetch API, 
#there's gonna be slightly diff behavior that we must account for
#which we can't take into consideration while using Postman because it's not a web browser
#Now we're gonna send a API request (run the app) from Google Chrome's inspect element > console
# fetch('http://localhost:8000').then(res => res.json()).then(console.log) 
#This sends a request to the root URL of our API and print whatever the server returns
#But we get an error that it's blocked by CORS policy whereas in Postman it works fine
#CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing), this policy allows us to make a request from
#a web browser on one domain to a server on a diff domain 
#When we configure an API through any framework/language, by default we are only
#able to send requests from a web browser running on the same exact domain as the server
#If our API is hosted on Google and website on Ebay, be default 
#Ebay can't send a request to an API running on a diff domain like Google
#CORS will block it. But if our website also runs on Google 
#then by default they'd be able to talk just fine  
#Now if we try to send a request to our API URL from our browser it'll work
#it's same as sending a API request from the browser's console like before
#This works because the website is in the same domain/URL as the API server
#If we want to allow people from other domains to talk to our API look at the documentation > CORS
#We use corsmiddleware to allow specific domains like Google
#but if we try from a diff domain like Youtube and send the same exact request
#from the browser's dev console, it'll give error     
#If we want to allow Youtube we just add it to our list of allowed origins 
# 
#--- GIT ---#
#Firstly create .gitignore file in root folder of the project, don't upload pycache, virtual env, .env 
#Generate "requirements.txt" to list all the packages and libraries we need to install
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
#If anyone clones our repo they need to install the dependencies based on the file
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#Install GIT, def branch name should be main
#need an account on github and create a new repo 
#initialize git in root folder of our project
# git init
# git add --all  
# git commit -m "initial commit"
#Gives us an error, tells us to setup our user for our account on this machine
# git config --global user.email azs@gmail.com 
# git config --global user.name azs
# git commit -m "initial commit" 
#Set what our branch is
# git branch -M main
#We've to setu a remote branch, we name it origin here
# git remote add origin https://github.com/arafe-zawad-sajid/FastAPI_Project 
#Finally we need to do a git push
# git push -u origin main  
#A popup asks us to sign in and authorize
#
