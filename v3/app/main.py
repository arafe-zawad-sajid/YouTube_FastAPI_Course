#--- With ORM (SQLAlchemy) ---#
#one way to interract with the db is to use the def postgresql driver (psycopg2) 
#to talk to a postgresql db using sql queries
#another way to work with db is to use orm, it's a layer abstraction between our db and fastapi app
#instead of talking directly to a db we talk to the orm which will in turn talk to the db
#no more sql, we use python code that ultimately translates to sql themselves
#when using orm we don't rely on regular sql queries, instead we use some basic python method
#traditionally, our fastapi server talks to our db by sending sql using def postgresql driver (psycopg2)
#for orm, fastapi uses regular python to send commands to orm 
#which converts it to regular sql using the same db driver (psycopg2) to talk to the db
#databases only talk sql
#sql alchemy is the most popular python orm, it's a stand-alone lib
#sql alchemy doesn't actually know how to talk to a db, it uses the underlying driver psycopg2
#
#schema/pydantic model vs. orm/sql alchemy model
#Post class extends BaseModel which is imported from pydantic lib, this is our schema
#it's being referenced in our path operations, it defines the shape of our requests and response
#we take the request and pass it to the pydantic model which will perform validation
#to make sure we have all the fields that we need and are of the proper type
#validates all the data fields provided in the body according to the schema
#it tells the user what we exactly need for each specific path/route
#similarly we define exactly what the response should look like
#we define a model to dictate FastAPI exactly the data fields that we should be sending back
#pydantic/schema model ensures that the request and response are shaped in a specific way
#technically we don't need pydantic models but it allows us to be strict when sending/receiving data
#it ensures that everything matches up with what we expect
#schema and orm models are diff
#models.Post class is our sql alchemy model, it defines what our db table looks like
#it is used to perform queries within our db
